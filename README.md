Here is the link to the API source/documentation.

2. Things to fix/add:

- The app isn't building correctly, find the issues and fix.
- Determine why the details screen isnâ€™t showing all the mapped information correctly and fix.
- There are inconstancies in the text formatting in the application, find where the issues are and fix them. A good approach is to centralize the use of a specific font style.
- Add some code documentation following Apple's standard formatting convention.
- There is an API request that needs to be added noted by // TODO: Implement the request here.

Bonus: Feel free to make any changes and cleanup any code that you feel will improve this application. Provide an additional Readme file documenting why the changes are an improvement.
